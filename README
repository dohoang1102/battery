Battery
=======

Introduction
------------
Battery displays the battery status on portable computers. For this pupose,
the application will either place an icon into the system tray or use the app
icon, depending on how you compile it.
Battery will automatically pop up a notification if the battery's capacity
falls below a certain value.
Battery checks the first battery in the system only. All other batteries
are ignored so far.

This menulet is GPL'ed. Read the COPYING file.
All bugs reports should be sent to Andreas Schik <andreas@schik.de>.


Requirements
------------
o Battery has been developed and tested on GNU/Linux using the following
  versions of GNUstep on Linux:

gnustep-base	1.21
gnustep-back	0.19

o Note, that Battery will most probably not run on older versions of GNUstep.

o Battery depends on HAL and DBus. Access to DBus is made vis GNUstep's DBusKit.

o To use the system tray, Battery needs the TrayIconKit, which is available
  here:
  <github repository>


How to build Battery
--------------------
o To build Battery simply do the following:
	make

o If you wish to run Battery without system tray support, build it like this:
	nake trayicon=no


o To install Battery run:
	make [trayicon=no] install


Additional information
----------------------
The application uses the GNOME applet 'battstat' for inspiration. This applet
gave me the general direction on how to create the icon. See the 'gnome-applets'
subproject of the GNOME project.
