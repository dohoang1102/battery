Version 0.4
-----------

New Features:

- Battery is no longer a menulet for the Étoilé menu bar, but acts as a system
  tray icon.
- The system tray icon is created using the TrayIconKit framework.
- Battery can be compiled without system tray support. In that case the app icon
  is used as battery state indicator.
- DBus is now accessed via GNUstep's DBusKit.
- HAL has been replaced by UPower.
- Notifications are sent to the desktop's notification service using DBus.
- New icons in different sizes.

Version 0.3 (never offcially released)
--------------------------------------

New Features:

- The icon is implemented as NSImageView instead of as NSButton. The battery
  state pops up as a tooltip window when the mouse hover over the image.

Version 0.2 (never offcially released)
--------------------------------------

New Features:

- Removed libacpi.[hc] in favour of DBus and HAL. This makes the menulet more
  platform independent.


Version 0.1 (never offcially released)
--------------------------------------

Initial version. Features:

- Shows an icon displaying the battery percentage or an AC plug, depending
  on whether the laptop runs on AC power or battery.
- Shows an information panel with more details when clicking on the icon.
- Depends upon C code from the wmacpi WindowMaker docklet (libacpi.[hc]).
